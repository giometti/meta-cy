Warning
=======

Before using this code, you should consider that some paths are referred to the author's home directory, as shown here:

    $ rgrep '/home/giometti' .
    ./recipes-kernel/khello/khello_git.bb:SRC_URI = "git:///home/giometti/yocto/examples/khello;branch=master"
    ./recipes-kernel/linux-engicam/linux-engicam_5.15.bbappend:KERNEL_SRC = "git:///home/giometti/yocto/linux-engicam-nxp/"
    ./recipes-bsp/u-boot-engicam/u-boot-engicam_2022.04.bbappend:UBOOT_SRC = "git:///home/giometti/yocto/u-boot-engicam-nxp-2022.04/"
    ...

So, you have to fix these path names before using this meta layer.

Enjoy! :-)
